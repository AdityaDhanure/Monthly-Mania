# Champions League 

Here’s how to submit your solution for the "Monthly Mania's Champions League" using only the GitHub website, without using the terminal:

1. **Fork the Solution Repository**
  - Open the link to C Cube's GitHub repository (which will be provided).
  - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Navigate to Your Forked Repository**

  - Once the fork is complete, you’ll be automatically redirected to the forked repository in your GitHub account.
  - This is your own copy of the repository where you will make the necessary changes.

3. **Edit the month/README.md File**

  - In your forked repository, find the README.md file (usually listed on the main page of the repository).
  - Click on the month/README.md file to open it.
  - Click the pencil icon at the top-right of the file to edit the file.

4. **Update the month/README.md File**

  - In the text editor that appears, scroll down to the section where the participant information needs to be added.
  - Add your details in the following format:
```bash
  | Sr. No. | Student Name / Profile Link            | Solution Repo Link  
  | ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ 
  | 1       | [Your Name](your-github-profile-link)  | [Solution Repo](your-forked-repo-link) 
```

  **Update:**
  - Your GitHub profile link
  - Your name
  - The link to your forked solution repository

5. **Commit the Changes**
  - After updating the README.md file, scroll down to the “Commit changes” section.
  - Add a descriptive commit message, for example:
  - Added participant details to README.md
  - Select "Commit directly to the main branch" (this option should be selected by default).
  - Click on the green “Commit changes” button.

7. **Create a Pull Request**
  - After committing the changes, go back to the main page of your forked repository.
  - You should see a banner at the top of the page that says: “This branch is X commits ahead of C Cube:main.” Next to it, there will be a “Compare & pull request” button.
    Click on that button.
  **On the pull request page:**
  - Add a pull request title, and write a message in the description following the format shown in the video (review the video for the exact format).
  - Review the changes to ensure everything is correct.
  - Click the green “Create pull request” button to submit your pull request.

7. **Wait for Review**

Once the pull request is created, it will be reviewed by the repository maintainers.
You will be notified of the status of your submission once it's reviewed. You might receive feedback for further changes, or the pull request will be accepted directly.
Following these steps, you can complete the submission process entirely through the GitHub website without needing to use the terminal.
